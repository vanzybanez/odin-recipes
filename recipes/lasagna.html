            <p>
             If you’re like us, you can eat lasagna all the time! 
             A warm and cheesy lasagna dish is an ideal go-to meal for family gatherings and celebrations. 
             When topped with grated fresh parmesan cheese and a glass of pinot noir, a regular lasagna dish 
             on a Friday night is elevated to a gourmet meal fit for a king and queen. That’s exactly the kind 
             of experience you’ll enjoy at Mi’talia, the best lasagna restaurant in Miami. When you’re here, 
             you’ll want to try our Stone Oven Lasagna made with beef bolognese and paired with sourdough toast. 
             But as much as we eat and love this Italian favorite, have you ever wondered who invented lasagna? 
            </p>

            <p>
                The origins of the word lasagne or lasagna can be traced back to Ancient Greece.
                What we know as lasagne or lasagna is derived from the word “laganon”, which was 
                the first form of pasta. Laganon was a reference to flat sheets of pasta dough cut
                into thin strips. As you might expect, Laganon looked very different from what we 
                know to be a typical lasagna dish today. It consisted of layers of pasta and sauce 
                without traditional Italian ingredients. Ancient Rome was known to have a similar 
                dish called “lasanum”, which is Latin for container or pot. Italians used this word 
                to refer to the pot that the dish was served in. Eventually, the dish evolved and took 
                on the same name. The origins of what we know as twisted macaroni came later.
