    <h1>Simple Deviled Eggs</h1>

    <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
            In Italian, for example, the hot tomato sauce called Arrabbiata is made with dried red chili peppers,
            and the name literally translates to “angry” in Italian. With eggs, especially spicy and zesty eggs made
            with mustard, pepper, or other ingredients like paprika stuffed into the empty yolk cavity of half an egg, 
            they are called “deviled,” though in some places they’re also referred to as stuffed eggs, dressed eggs, 
            or even Russian eggs.

            The term deviled egg comes from an 18th-century culinary term that the Oxford English Dictionary
            originally used to describe a fried or boiled dish that was highly seasoned. and this was eventually
            used to also include spicy, condiment-filled dishes, as well. It was eventually used to describe eggs.
